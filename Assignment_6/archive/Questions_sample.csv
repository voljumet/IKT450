I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

5966,745,2008-08-08T14:05:45Z,10,Best way to abstract season/show/episode data,"<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>"

I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.</p>

<p>What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language?

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>

I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>

<p>It works fine in the <em>list</em> case because the <em>append</em> method modifies the object ""in place"", without returning it.

Colleagues at work are running the same version of svnmerge.py, and of python (2.5.2, specifically r252:60911) without an issue.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.nabble.com/problem-under-some-windows-desktop-td15868057.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>, which describes my problem.  Trying what was outlined there, I confirmed Python could find svn (it's in my path):</p>

<p>Looking at the svnmerge.py code, though, I noticed for python versions 2.4 and higher it was following a different execution path.  Rather than invoking
os.popen4() it uses subprocess.Popen().  Trying that reproduces the error:</p>

43368,4462,2008-09-04T08:53:58Z,11,A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?,"<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

45013,2168,2008-09-05T00:10:37Z,1,Can the HTTP version or headers affect the visual appearance of a web page?,"<p>I know, I would have thought the answer was obviously ""no"" as well, but I am experiencing a strange situation where when I view my site from our staging server it appears slightly larger than when I view it from my local dev server.  I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is ""zoomed in"" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p>

<p>This is all in Firefox 3.  I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p>

<p>Has anyone else encountered any bizarre behavior anything like this before?  I am at a loss.</p>

The result is <a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">BowlSK</a>.  However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Level contains:

<ul>
<li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li>
<li>all .html templates for main level pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subdirectories:

<ul>
<li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>
</ul></li>

<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at ""index.html""<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at ""games/view-series.html""</p>

<p>It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).  A common use is to lock a PDF so that end users can read it without entering any password, but a password is required to do anything else.</p>

<p>I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).  Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.</p>

<p>What I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read (ideally Python, C, or C++, but anything readable will do) that does this so that I can understand what I'm meant to be doing.  Standalone code, rather than reading through (e.g.) the gsview source, would be best.</p>

51502,5342,2008-09-09T10:05:36Z,2,Improving Python readability?,"<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>

<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>

<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

51553,5357,2008-09-09T10:33:39Z,11,Why are SQL aggregate functions so much slower than Python and Java (or Poor Man's OLAP),"<p>I need a real DBA's opinion. Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(id), avg(a), avg(b), avg(c), avg(d) FROM tuples;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?</p>

<p>The schema (the table holds responses to a survey):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action

<p>I'm using a brute force method, where the computer generates some random daily polling data and then calculates three day averages to see if the average of the random data matches pollsters numbers. (Most companies poll numbers are three day averages)</p>

<p>Currently, it works well for one iteration, but my goal is to have it produce the most common simulation that matches the average polling data. I could then change the code of anywhere from 1 to 1000 iterations. </p>

<p>And this is my problem. At the end of the test I have an array in a single variable that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[40.1, 39.4, 56.7, 60.0, 20.0 ..... 19.0]
</code></pre>

<p>The program currently produces one array for each correct simulation. <em>I can store each array in a single variable, but I then have to have a program that could generate 1 to 1000 variables depending on how many iterations I requested!?</em> </p>

<p>How do I avoid this? I know there is an intelligent way of doing this that doesn't require the program to generate variables to store arrays depending on how many simulations I want.</p>

61894,4904,2008-09-15T05:21:47Z,3,What's a good way to find relative paths in Google App Engine?,"<p>So I've done the trivial ""warmup"" apps with GAE.  Now I'd like to build something with a more complex directory structure.  Something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>siteroot/
	models/
	controllers/
		controller1/
		controller2/
		...
	templates/
		template1/
		template2/
		...
</code></pre>

<p>..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate (Django-style) templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps I've seen resolve template paths like this:</p>

<pre><code>path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'myPage.html')
</code></pre>

<p>...the __ file __ property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllers/controller1/, then the 'myPage.html' would resolve to that same directory -- controllers/controller1/myPage.html -- and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.</p>

<p>The solution I've hacked together feels... hacky:</p>

<pre><code>base_paths = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))
template_dir = os.path.join(base_paths[0], ""templates"")
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other (non-GAE specific) solutions I've seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight (such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly).  Django seems to have an answer for this, but I'd rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.</p>

<p>I'm assuming anything hard-coded would be non-starter, since the apps live on Google's infinite server farm.  So what's a better way?</p>

70528,1943957,2008-09-16T08:59:32Z,344,Why are Python's 'private' methods not actually private?,"<p>Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like this: <code>__myPrivateMethod()</code>. How, then, can one explain this</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I try and call its private method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>So much for encapsulation, eh?</p>

<p>In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?</p>

The issue I'm having is that the page should work using the form's initial values (unbound), but I can't access the cleaned_data field unless I call is_valid(). But is_valid() always fails on unbound forms.</p>

<p>It seems like Django's forms were designed with the use case of editing data such that an unbound form isn't really useful for anything other than displaying HTML.</p>

<p>For example, if I have:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)

if form.is_valid():
    do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

<p>is_valid() will fail if this is a GET (since it's unbound), and if I do:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
    do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
</code></pre>

<p>the first call to do_query triggers exceptions on form.cleaned_data, which is not a valid field because is_valid() has not been called. It seems like I have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
    do_query(form['start_date'].field.initial, form['end_date'].field.initial)
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

<p>that is, there isn't a common interface for retrieving the form's values between a bound form and an unbound one.</p>

78900,11886,2008-09-17T01:22:56Z,3,How to check for memory leaks in Guile extension modules?,"<p>I develop an extension module for Guile, written in C.  This extension module embeds a Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Since this extension module invokes the Python interpreter, I need to verify that it properly manages the memory occupied by Python objects.  </p>

<p>I found that the Python interpreter is well-behaved in its own memory handling, so that by running valgrind I can find memory leaks due to bugs in my own Python interpreter embedding code, if there are no other interfering factors.  </p>

<p>However, when I run Guile under valgrind, valgrind reports memory leaks.  Such memory leaks obscure any memory leaks due to my own code.  </p>

<p>The question is what can I do to separate memory leaks due to bugs in my code from memory leaks reported by valgrind as due to Guile.  Another tool instead of valgrind?  Special valgrind options?  Give up and rely upon manual code walkthrough?</p>

79454,10840,2008-09-17T02:52:58Z,5,Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?,"<p>Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).</p>

<p>I chose a mocking library called <a href=""http://labix.org/mocker"" rel=""nofollow"">mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():
    def test(config):
        ac = AppController()
        m = Mocker()
        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)
        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))
        with m:
            result = ac.current_window_controller()
            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)
    yield test, []
    yield test, [0]
    yield test, [1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:</p>

<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):
    try:
        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting
        # with the controller of the top-most window
        # assumption: the top-most window is the ""current"" one
        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return wc
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>

<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>

<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>

We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>

<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>
</ol>

<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.</p>

<p>Now, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>

<p>I've compiled the regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>regex = re.compile(r'''
    &lt;h[0-9]&gt;\s?
    (&lt;a[ ]href=""[A-Za-z0-9.]*""&gt;)?\s?
    [A-Za-z0-9.,:'""=/?;\s]*\s?
    [A-Za-z0-9.,:'""=/?;\s]?
''',  re.X)
</code></pre>

<p>When i run this in python reg ex. tester, it works out wonderfully.</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Dog &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Cat &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Fancy &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Tall cup of lemons&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""dog.com""&gt;Dog thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in the REDemo, it works wonderfully.</p>

<p>When i put it in my python code, however, it only prints <code>&lt;a href=""dog.com""&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here's my python code, I'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong or if something is lost in translation. I appreciate your help.</p>

<pre><code>stories=[]
response = urllib2.urlopen('http://apricotclub.org/duh.html')
html = response.read().lower()
p = re.compile('&lt;h[0-9]&gt;\\s?(&lt;a href=\""[A-Za-z0-9.]*\""&gt;)?\\s?[A-Za-z0-9.,:\'\""=/?;\\s]*\\s?[A-Za-z0-9.,:\'\""=/?;\\s]?')
stories=re.findall(p, html)
for i in stories:
    if len(i) &gt;= 5:
        print i 
</code></pre>

<p>I should also note, that when i take out the <code>(&lt;a href=\""[A-Za-z0-9.]*\""&gt;)?</code> from the regular expression it works fine for non-link <code>&lt;hN&gt;</code> lines.</p>

It has a page - mylovelypage</p>

<p>For the moment, the page just does <code>self.response.out.write('OK')</code></p>

<p>If I run the following Python at my computer:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib2
f = urllib2.urlopen(""http://mylovelyapp.appspot.com/mylovelypage"")
s = f.read()
print s
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>it prints ""OK""</p>

<p>the problem is if I add <code>login:required</code> to this page in the app's yaml</p>

<p>then this prints out the HTML of the Google Accounts login page</p>

<p>I've tried ""normal"" authentication approaches. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>passman = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()

auth_handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
auth_handler.add_password(None,
                          uri='http://mylovelyapp.appspot.com/mylovelypage',

opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_handler)
urllib2.install_opener(opener)

<p>I've tried <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps.html"">Google's ClientLogin auth API</a>, but I can't get it to work.</p>

myrequest = ""Email=%s&amp;Passwd=%s&amp;service=ah&amp;source=DALELANE-0.0"" % (""billy.bob@gmail.com"", ""billybobspassword"")
response, content = h.request(auth_uri, 'POST', body=myrequest, headers=headers)

if response['status'] == '200':
    authtok = re.search('Auth=(\S*)', content).group(1)

    headers = {}

        response, content = h.request(response['location'], 'POST', body="""", headers=headers) 

    print content

<p>I do seem to be able to get some token correctly, but attempts to use it in the header when I call 'mylovelypage' still just return me the login page's HTML. :-( </p>

<p>Can anyone help, please?</p>

<p>Could I use the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/"">GData client library</a> to do this sort of thing? From

This code:</p>

being used as such. I handle it by filling a type symbol table in the
parser that gets used by the lexer to differentiate between types and
simple identifiers.</p>

<p>However, while the type declaration rule ends with SEMI (the ';' token), PLY shifts the token <code>my_type</code> from the second line before deciding it's done with the first one. Because of this, I have no chance to pass the update in the type symbol table to the lexer and it
sees my_type as an identifier and not a type.</p>

<p>If it recieves a <strong>SIGTSTP</strong> while printing <strong>Q</strong>s, it will print ten <strong>Z</strong>s after it's done with the ten <strong>Q</strong>s. This is a good thing.</p>

<p>However, if it recieves a <strong>SIGQUIT</strong> while printing <strong>Z</strong>s, it fails to print <strong>Q</strong>s after them. Instead, it prints them out only after I manually terminate execution via a KeyboardInterrupt. I want the <strong>Q</strong>s to be printed immediately after the <strong>Z</strong>s.</p>

In one class I calculate the attributes of the character. In a different class, I'm displaying to the user which specialties are available based on the attributes of the character. However, I can't remember how to pass variables between different classes.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I have:</p>

<pre><code>class BasicInfoPage(wx.wizard.WizardPageSimple):            
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
         wiz.WizardPageSimple.__init__(self, parent)
         self.next = self.prev = None
         self.sizer = makePageTitle(self, title)

                    &lt;---snip---&gt;

         self.intelligence = self.genAttribs()

class MOS(wx.wizard.WizardPageSimple):
     def __init__(self, parent, title):
         wiz.WizardPageSimple.__init__(self, parent)
         self.next = self.prev = None
         self.sizer = makePageTitle(self, title)
      def eligibleMOS(self, event):
          if self.intelligence &gt;= 12: 
               self.MOS_list.append(""Analyst"")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I can't figure out how to use the ""intelligence"" variable from the BasicInfoPage class to the MOS class. I've tried several different things from around the Internet but nothing seems to work. What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I realized after I posted this that I didn't explain it that well. I'm trying to create a computer version of the Twilight 2000 RPG from the 1980s.</p>

<p>I'm using wxPython to create a wizard; the parent class of my classes is the Wizard from wxPython. That wizard will walk a user through the creation of a character, so the Basic Information page (class BasicInfoPage) lets the user give the character's name and ""roll"" for the character's attributes. That's where the ""self.intelligence"" comes from.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the attributes created her for a page further on in the wizard, where the user selects the speciality of the character. The specialities that are available depend on the attributes the character has, e.g. if the intelligence is high enough, the character can be an Intel Anaylst.</p>

<p>It's been several years since I've programmed, especially with OOP ideas. That's why I'm confused on how to create what's essentially a global variable with classes and methods. </p>

<p>How can I tune Pylint to properly take fields such as objects into account?  (I've also looked into the Django source, and I have been unable to find the implementation of <code>objects</code>, so I suspect it is not ""just"" a class field.  On the other hand, I'm fairly new to python, so I may very well have overlooked something.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.  If there is another way, without augmenting the pylint source, please point me to specifics :)</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://creswick.github.io/blog/2008/09/05/wrestling-python/"">here</a> for a summary of the problems I've had with <code>pychecker</code> and <code>pyflakes</code> -- they've proven to be far to unstable for general use.

<p>A paragraph is defined by 2 linebreaks (\n). But one can have any ammount of spaces/tabs together with the line breaks, and it still should be considered as a paragraph.</p>

<p>I am using python so the solution can use python's <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Python re syntax"">regular expression syntax</a> which is extended. (can make use of <code>(?P...)</code> stuff)</p>

<h1>Examples:</h1>

<pre><code>the_str = 'paragraph1\n\nparagraph2'
# splitting should yield ['paragraph1', 'paragraph2']

the_str = 'p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t   \n     \n\tp3'
# should yield ['p1', 'p2\t\n\tstill p2', 'p3']

the_str = 'p1\n\n\n\tp2'
# should yield ['p1', '\n\tp2']
</code></pre>

<p>The best I could come with is: <code>r'[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*'</code> but that is ugly. Anything better?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<h1>Suggestions rejected:</h1>

<p><code>r'\s*?\n\s*?\n\s*?'</code> -> That would make example 2 and 3 fail, since <code>\s</code> includes <code>\n</code>, so it would allow paragraph breaks with more than 2 <code>\n</code>s.</p>

I'm comfortable programming Python, but I'm not very familiar with Python ""idiom,"" especially regarding classes and objects. Python's object oriented design differs somewhat from other languages I've worked with. So, even though my application is working, I'm curious whether there is a better way to accomplish my goals.</p>

<p>Specifics: How does one typically implement the request-transform-render database workflow in Python? Currently, I am using pyodbc to fetch data, copying the results into attributes on an object, performing some calculations and merges using a list of these objects, then rendering the output from the list of objects. (Sample code below, SQL queries redacted.) Is this sane? Is there a better way? Are there any specific ""gotchas"" I've stumbled into in my relative ignorance of Python?

118540,NA,2008-09-23T01:04:10Z,0,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>

<pre><code>find ~/podcasts/current -mindepth 2 -mtime '+`a`+' -exec mv {} ~/podcasts/old \;
</code></pre>

<p>I am familiar with the os.name and getpass.getuser for the most general cross-platform elements.  I also have this function to generate a list of the full names of all the files in the equivalent of ~/podcasts/current:</p>

<pre><code>def AllFiles(filepath, depth=1, flist=[]):
    fpath=os.walk(filepath)
    fpath=[item for item in fpath]
    while depth &lt; len(fpath):
    	for item in fpath[depth][-1]:
    		flist.append(fpath[depth][0]+os.sep+item)
    	depth+=1
    return flist
</code></pre>

<p>First off, there must be a better way to do that, any suggestion welcome.  Either way, for example, ""AllFiles('/users/me/music/itunes/itunes music/podcasts')"" gives the relevant list, on Windows.  Presumably I should be able to go over this list and call os.stat(list_member).st_mtime and move all the stuff older than a certain number in days to the archive; I am a little stuck on that bit.</p>

<p>Of course, anything with the concision of the bash command would also be illuminating.</p>

119802,3355,2008-09-23T08:19:44Z,11,Using **kwargs with SimpleXMLRPCServer in python,"<p>I have a class that I wish to expose as a remote service using pythons SimpleXMLRPCServer. The server startup looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>server = SimpleXMLRPCServer((serverSettings.LISTEN_IP,serverSettings.LISTEN_PORT))

service = Service()

server.register_instance(service)
server.serve_forever()

<p>I then have a ServiceRemote class that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self,ip,port):
    self.rpcClient = xmlrpclib.Server('http://%s:%d' %(ip,port))

def __getattr__(self, name):
    # forward all calls to the rpc client
    return getattr(self.rpcClient, name)

<p>So all calls on the ServiceRemote object will be forwarded to xmlrpclib.Server, which then forwards it to the remote server. The problem is a method in the service that takes named varargs:</p>

<pre><code>@useDb
def select(self, db, fields, **kwargs):
    pass

<p>The @useDb decorator wraps the function, creating the db before the call and opening it, then closing it after the call is done before returning the result.</p>

<p>When I call this method, I get the error ""<strong>call</strong>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'"". So, is it possible to call methods taking variable named arguments remotely? Or will I have to create an override for each method variation I need.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses. I changed my code around a bit so the question is no longer an issue. However now I know this for future reference if I indeed do need to implement positional arguments and support remote invocation. I think a combination of Thomas and praptaks approaches would be good. Turning kwargs into positional args on the client through xmlrpclient, and having a wrapper on methods serverside to unpack positional arguments.</p>

I really would like to know how to generate a list of N unique random numbers using a functional language such as Ruby without having to be extremely imperative in style.</p>

I've been told this post came across as rather snobbish. I wasn't trying to imply that LINQ is better than Ruby/Python; or that my solution is much better than everyone else's. My intent is just to learn how to do this (with certain constraints) in Ruby. I'm sorry if I came across as a jerk.</p>

127736,17663,2008-09-24T15:08:50Z,2,How to implement a Decorator with non-local equality?,"<p>Greetings, currently I am refactoring one of my programs, and I found an interesting problem.</p>

<p>I have Transitions in an automata. Transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. Some Transitions have a label, which encodes a certain Action that must be performed upon traversal. No label means no action. Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.</p>

<p>I need the following operations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>check if the transition has a label</li>
<li>get this label</li>
<li>add a label to a transition</li>
<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>
<li>get this condition</li>
<li>check for equality</li>
</ul>

<p>Judging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition. However, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(""foo"", Conditional(""bar"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) and Conditional(""bar"", Labeled(""foo"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:</p>

<pre><code>class Transition(object):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
    def get_label(self):
        return None
    def has_label(self):
        return False
    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):
        return decorations
    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):
        try:
            return (self.start == other.start
                    and self.end == other.end
                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)

class Labeled(object):
    def __init__(self, label, base):
        self.base = base
        self.label = label
    def has_label(self):
        return True
    def get_label(self):
        return self.label
    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):
        assert 'label' not in decorations
        decorations['label'] = self.label
        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)
    def __getattr__(self, attribute):
        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a clean approach? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I am mostly confused, because I can solve this - with longer class names - using cooperative multiple inheritance:</p>

<pre><code>class Transition(object):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # init is pythons MI-madness ;-)
        super(Transition, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.start = kwargs['start']
        self.end = kwargs['end']
    def get_label(self):
        return None
    def get_condition(self):
        return None
    def __eq__(self, other):
        try:
            return self.start == other.start and self.end == other.end
        except AttributeError:
            return False

class LabeledTransition(Transition):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(LabeledTransition).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.label = kwargs['label']
    def get_label(self):
        return self.label
    def __eq__(self):
        super_result = super(LabeledTransition, self).__eq__(other)
        try:
            return super_result and self.label == other.label
        except AttributeError:
            return False

class ConditionalTransition(Transition):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(ConditionalTransition, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.condition = kwargs['condition']

    def get_condition(self):
        return self.condition

    def __eq__(self, other):
        super_result = super(ConditionalTransition, self).__eq__(other)
        try:
            return super_result and self.condition = other.condition
        except AttributeError:
            return False

# ConditionalTransition about the same, with get_condition
class LabeledConditionalTransition(LabeledTransition, ConditionalTransition):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>the class LabledConditionalTransition behaves exactly as expected - and having no code in there is appealing and I do not thing MI is confusing at this size.</p>

<p>Of course, the third option would be to just hammer everything into a single transition class with a bunch of in has_label/has_transition.</p>

<p>So... I am confused. Am I missing something? Which implementation looks better? How do you handle similar cases, that is, objects which look like a Decorator could handle them, but then, such a non-local method comes around?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>:
Added the ConditionalTransition-class. Basically, this kinda behaves like the decorator, minus the order created by the order of creating the decorators, the transition checks for start and end being correct, the LabeledTransition-class checks for label being correct and ConditionalTransition checks for condition being correct.</p>

<p><code>[(id\__1_, description, id\_type), (id\__2_, description, id\_type), ... , (id\__n_, description, id\_type))</code></p>

<p>The data are loaded from files that belong to the same group. In each group there could be multiples of the same id, each coming from different files. I don't care about the duplicates, so I thought that a nice way to store all of this would be to throw it into a Set type. But there's a problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes for the same id the descriptions can vary slightly, as follows:</p>

<p>IPI00110753</p>

<ul>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1A chain</li>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1 chain</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin 1</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin isotype M-alpha-1</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that this example is taken from the <a href=""http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68369"" rel=""nofollow"">uniprot protein database</a>.) </p>

<p>I don't care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.</p>

<p>I am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don't really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID's). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID's go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.</p>

<p>I have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven't thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? </p>

<p>Thank you for reading my question, <br>
Tim</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>based on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. </p>

<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?</p>

<p>*The information is a list of Swiss-Prot protein identifiers that I get by querying uniprot.</p>

Does anyone have a perl (or Python) script that allows the specification of a user and group for removal?  Am I missing an obvious existing command, or well-known solution forthis?  Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thanks to J.J. for the pointer to the Unix::Group module, which is part of Unix-ConfigFile.  It looks like the command deluser would do what I want, but was not in any of my existing repositories.  I went ahead and wrote the perl script using the Unix:Group Module.  Here is the script for your sysadmining pleasure.</p>

<p>Visual Studio defines several dozen ""Macros"" which are sort of simulated environment variables (completely unrelated to C++ macros) which contain information about the build in progress.  Examples:</p>

<pre>
    ConfigurationName  Release
    TargetPath         D:\work\foo\win\Release\foo.exe
    VCInstallDir       C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\
</pre>

<p>Here is the complete set of 43 built-in Macros that I see (yours may differ depending on which version of VS you use and which tools you have enabled):</p>

<pre>
    ConfigurationName  IntDir           RootNamespace      TargetFileName
    DevEnvDir          OutDir           SafeInputName      TargetFramework
    FrameworkDir       ParentName       SafeParentName     TargetName
    FrameworkSDKDir    PlatformName     SafeRootNamespace  TargetPath
    FrameworkVersion   ProjectDir       SolutionDir        VCInstallDir
    FxCopDir           ProjectExt       SolutionExt        VSInstallDir
    InputDir           ProjectFileName  SolutionFileName   WebDeployPath
    InputExt           ProjectName      SolutionName       WebDeployRoot
    InputFileName      ProjectPath      SolutionPath       WindowsSdkDir
    InputName          References       TargetDir          WindowsSdkDirIA64
    InputPath          RemoteMachine    TargetExt             
</pre>

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

134626,4872,2008-09-25T17:15:03Z,58,Which is more preferable to use in Python: lambda functions or nested functions ('def')?,"<p>I mostly use lambda functions but sometimes use nested functions that seem to provide the same behavior. </p>

<p>Here are some trivial examples where they functionally do the same thing if either were found within another function:</p>

<p><strong>Lambda function</strong></p>

<p>In a unit test file, I’m trying to grab this URL using <code>django.core.urlresolvers.reverse()</code>, instead of just copying '/categories/' (DRY and all that). So, I have:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

<p>It matches just fine if I make the URL pattern a named pattern, like this:</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^categories/$', views.categories, 'myapp-categories')

The servers will communicate with each other in a cluster. Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table. The exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning, and it's important that it's possible for the person running the cluster (eg, myself) to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server.</p>

<p>Simply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.</p>

<p>What I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>

<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression. You can also concatenate multiple independent result sets together.</p>

<p>I realise this question sounds a lot like I'm asking for SQL. However, I don't want to require that the datastore backing this data be a relational database, and I don't want the overhead of trying to reimplement SQL myself. I'm also dealing with only a single table with a known schema. Finally, no joins will be required. Something much simpler would be far preferable.</p>

140295,5442,2008-09-26T15:38:00Z,2,Using locale.setlocale in embedded Python without breaking file parsing in C thread,"<p>We're using a third-party middleware product that allows us to write code in an embedded Python interpreter, and which exposes an API that we can call into. Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.</p>

<p>We've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>

<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
currentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
displayNumbersToTheUser()
locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.</p>

<p>Any information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it's in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don't want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>

<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
{% for address in addresses %} 
  {% address.as_html4 %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
{% for address in addresses %}
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, then: Where is the best place to put the formatting? The logic?</p>

<p>Django seem to have the following (plausible) options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the formatting in models.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in views.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in some other sub-class of Person or Address (i.e.  addresses/html4.py)</p></li>
<li><p>Create custom tags</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Help / insight much appreciated!</p>

147816,1163767,2008-09-29T07:32:55Z,71,Preserving signatures of decorated functions,"<p>Suppose I have written a decorator that does something very generic. For example, it might convert all arguments to a specific type, perform logging, implement memoization, etc.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return g

@args_as_ints
def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""Computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z

&gt;&gt;&gt; funny_function(""3"", 4.0, z=""5"")
22
</code></pre>

<p>Everything well so far. There is one problem, however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function g in module __main__:

g(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately, there is a workaround:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g

@args_as_ints
def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""Computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the function name and documentation are correct:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function funny_function in module __main__:

funny_function(*args, **kwargs)
    Computes x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>But there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information ""*args, **kwargs"" is next to useless.</p>

<p>What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:</p>

<p>1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>

<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):
    def g(x, y, z=3):
        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>

<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of ""*kwargs, **kwargs"" when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?</p>

<p>Any other approaches?</p>

<p>Using code from <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576451/"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveState</a>'s site and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how"">StackOverflow</a>, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:</p>

<pre><code>server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a ""stop"" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:</p>

<pre><code>def SvcStop(self):
    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
    exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to get called when I do ""python myservice stop"" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to ""python myservice start"" gives me an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error starting service: An instance of
  the service is already running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and subsequent calls to stop gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error stopping service: The service
  cannot accept control messages at this
  time. (1061)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.</p>

<p>My first alternative, While only iterating through the list once and avoiding the list expansion (and keeping the <a href=""http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/splitLoop.html"">split loop</a> refactoring in mind), looks rather bloated:</p>

<p>(alt 1)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

twos = 0
threes = 0

for v in r:
  if v % 2 == 0:
    twos+=1
  if v % 3 == 0:
    threes+=1

print twos
print threes
</code></pre>

<p>This looks rather nice, but has the drawback of expanding the expression to a list:</p>

<p>(alt 2)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print len([1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0])
print len([1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0])
</code></pre>

<p>What I would really like is something like a function like this:</p>

<p>(alt 3)</p>

<pre><code>def count(iterable):
  n = 0
  for i in iterable:
    n += 1
  return n

r = xrange(1, 10)

print count(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print count(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>But this looks a lot like something that could be done without a function. The final variant is this:</p>

<p>(alt 4)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print sum(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print sum(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>and while the smallest (and in my book probably the most elegant) it doesn't feel like it expresses the intent very well.</p>

<p>So, my question to you is:</p>

<p>Which alternative do you like best to gather these types of stats? Feel free to supply your own alternative if you have something better.</p>

<p>To clear up some confusion below:</p>

<ul>
<li>In reality my filter predicates are more complex than just this simple test.</li>
<li>The objects I iterate over are larger and more complex than just numbers</li>
<li>My filter functions are more different and hard to parameterize into one predicate</li>

The problem comes when we come to analyse the data because sorting by something other than the timestamp and then sorting by timestamp again can leave the data in the wrong order (chronologically). It would be nice to have the time stamps accurate to the point that any call to the time stamp generator gives a unique timestamp.</p>

<p>I had been considering some methods involving using a time.clock() call added to a starting datetime, but would appreciate a solution that would work accurately across threads on the same machine. Any suggestions would be very gratefully received.</p>

<p>Lets say for example I had a room module and a person module containing CRoom and CPerson.</p>

<p>The CRoom class contains infomation about the room, and a CPerson list of every one in the room.</p>

<p>The CPerson class however sometimes needs to use the CRoom class for the room its in, for example to find the door, or too see who else is in the room.</p>

<p>The problem is with the two modules importing each other I just get an import error on which ever is being imported second :(</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Mods(models.Model):

<p>How does one get a list of Cars, grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p>

<p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p>

<pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ 
  { mods: { 'a' }, cars: { 'W1', 'W2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b' }, cars: { 'X1', 'X2', 'X3' }, },

  mod_list = []      

  for car in cars:
    mod_list.append( { 'car': car, 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } 

  ret = []

  for key, mods_group in groupby(list(mods), lambda x: set(x.mods)):
    ret.append(mods_group)

  return ret
</code></pre>

<p>However, that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say, I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating.</p>

160834,2168,2008-10-02T03:55:22Z,6,Are there any other good alternatives to zc.buildout and/or virtualenv for installing non-python dependencies?,"<p>I am a member of a team that is about to launch a beta of a python (Django specifically) based web site and accompanying suite of backend tools.  The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.</p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>

<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>

<p>$ git clone [repository url]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...</p>

<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>

<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>

<p>Is there a simple way of providing access to the private members of a class that I wish to subclass? Often I wish to simply work with the raw data objects inside of a class without having to use accessors and mutators all the time.</p>

<p>I know this seems to go against the general idea of private and public, but usually the class I am trying to subclass is one of my own which I am quite happy to expose the members from to a subclass but not to an instance of that class. Is there a clean way of providing this distinction?</p>

163603,1694,2008-10-02T17:40:38Z,4,Apache sockets not closing?,"<p>I have a web application written using CherryPy, which is run locally on <code>127.0.0.1:4321</code>.  We use mod-rewrite and mod-proxy to have Apache act as a reverse proxy; Apache also handles our SSL encryption and may eventually be used to transfer all of our static content.</p>

<p>This all works just fine for small workloads.  However, I recently used <code>urllib2</code> to write a stress-testing script that would simulate a workload of 100 clients.  After some time, each client gets a 503 error from Apache, indicating that Apache cannot connect to <code>127.0.0.1:4321</code>.  CherryPy is functioning properly, but my Apache error log reveals lines like the following:</p>

<p><code>[Thu Oct 02 12:55:44 2008] [error] (OS 10048)Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.  : proxy: HTTP: attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:4321 (*) failed</code></p>

<p>Googling for this error reveals that Apache has probably run out of socket file descriptors.  Since I only have 100 clients running, this implies that the connections are not being closed, either between my <code>urllib2</code> connection and Apache (I am definitely calling <code>.close()</code> on the return value of <code>urlopen</code>), or between Apache and CherryPy.</p>

<p>I've confirmed that my <code>urllib2</code> request is sending an HTTP <code>Connection: close</code> header, although Apache is configured with <code>KeepAlive On</code> if that matters.</p>

<p>In case it matters, I'm using Python 2.5, Apache 2.2, CherryPy 3.0.3, and the server is running on Windows Server 2003.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a whole other site, like i.xxxx.com.  Tie it into the same database using Django's sites framework.</li>
<li>Find some time of middleware that reads the user-agent, and changes the template directories dynamically.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd really prefer option #2, however; I have some reservations, mainly because the Django documentation <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/"">discourages changing settings on the fly</a>.  I found a <a href=""http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1098/"">snippet</a> that would do the what I'd like.  My main issue is having it as seamless as possible, I'd like it to be automagic and transparent to the user.</p>

<p>Has anyone else come across the same issue?  Would anyone care to share about how they've tackled making IPhone versions of Django sites?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I went with a combination of middleware and tweaking the template call.</p>

<p>For the middleware, I used <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/minidetector/"">minidetector</a>.  I like it because it detects a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6E682C7Jj4"">plethora</a> of mobile user-agents.  All I have to do is check request.mobile in my views.</p>

<p>For the template call tweak:</p>

<pre><code> def check_mobile(request, template_name):
     if request.mobile:
         return 'mobile-%s'%template_name
     return template_name
</code></pre>

<p>I use this for any view that I know I have both versions.</p>

<p><strong>TODO:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out how to access <em>request.mobile</em> in an extended version of render_to_response so I don't have to use check_mobile('template_name.html')</li>
<li>Using the previous automagically fallback to the regular template if no mobile version exists.</li>

Since the algorithm is super-duper complicated, the package has to contain an auxiliary class for algorithm options. Currently I'm developing the entire package by myself (and I'm not a programmer), however I expect 1-2 programmers to join the project later.

168167,1694,2008-10-03T18:16:08Z,2,Initializing cherrypy.session early,"<p>I love CherryPy's API for sessions, except for one detail.  Instead of saying <code>cherrypy.session[""spam""]</code> I'd like to be able to just say <code>session[""spam""]</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't simply have a global <code>from cherrypy import session</code> in one of my modules, because the <code>cherrypy.session</code> object isn't created until the first time a page request is made.  Is there some way to get CherryPy to initialize its session object immediately instead of on the first page request?</p>

<p>I have two ugly alternatives if the answer is no:</p>

<p>First, I can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>def import_session():
    global session
    while not hasattr(cherrypy, ""session""):
        sleep(0.1)
    session = cherrypy.session

Thread(target=import_session).start()

<p>This feels like a big kludge, but I really hate writing <code>cherrypy.session[""spam""]</code> every time, so to me it's worth it.</p>

<p>My second solution is to do something like</p>

<pre><code>class SessionKludge:
    def __getitem__(self, name):
        return cherrypy.session[name]
    def __setitem__(self, name, val):
        cherrypy.session[name] = val

session = SessionKludge()

<p>but this feels like an even bigger kludge and I'd need to do more work to implement the other dictionary functions such as <code>.get</code></p>

<p>So I'd definitely prefer a simple way to initialize the object myself.  Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

172392,2260,2008-10-05T18:23:19Z,5,What symmetric cypher to use for encrypting messages?,"<p>I haven't a clue about encryption at all. But I need it. How?</p>

<p>Say you have a system of nodes communicating with each other on a network via asynchronous messages. The nodes do not maintain session information about other nodes (this is a design restriction).</p>

<p>Say you want to make sure only your nodes can read the messages being sent. I believe encryption is the sollution to that.</p>

<p>Since the nodes are not maintaining a session and communication must work in a stateless, connectionless fashion, I am guessing that asymmetric encryption is ruled out.</p>

<p>So here is what I would like to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>messages are sent as UDP datagrams</li>
<li>each message contains a timestamp to make messages differ (counter replay attacks)</li>
<li>each message is encrypted with a shared secret symmetric key and sent over the network</li>
<li>other end can decrypt with shared secret symmetric key</li>
</ul>

<p>Keys can obviously be compromised by compromising any single node. At the same time, in this scenario, access to any single compromised node reveals all interesting information anyway, so the key is not the weakest link.</p>

<p>What cypher should I use for this encryption? What key length?</p>

<p>I would prefer to use something supported by <a href=""http://www.freenet.org.nz/ezPyCrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">ezPyCrypto</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming, as most point out, I go with AES. What modes should I be using?</p>

<p>I couldn't figure out how to do it with ezPyCrypto, <a href=""http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">PyCrypto</a> seems to be hung on a moderator swap and googles <a href=""http://www.keyczar.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">keyczar</a> does not explain how to set this up - I fear if I don't just <em>get</em> it, then I run a risk of introducing insecurity.

I have a situation in which I want to definitively and unquestionably exit from inside a test case, however the unittest module catches SystemExit and prevents the exit.

In this case I want to exit and prevent any further tests from being run.  Of course since unittest traps the SystemExit and continues happily on it's way, it is thwarting me.</p>

In other words, I don't get a DatabaseConnection object back, I get a MSSQLDatabaseConnection or OracleDatabaseConnection object back instead, which of course inherit from DatabaseConnection.</p>

<p>The connection string contains information about what kind of database engine and version this connection is for.</p>

<p>I'd like to create a similar library in Python. Is the right approach to make something that can be constructed like this?</p>

<pre><code>conn = DatabaseConnection(""..."")
</code></pre>

<p>or using a class method?</p>

<pre><code>conn = DatabaseConnection.FromConnectionString(""..."")
</code></pre>

<p>is the first even possible, that is... constructing an object like this and getting back something else, a specialized object, depending on data in the passed string?</p>

<p>Ok, let me ask a different question... What is the <em>pythonic</em> way of doing this?</p>

<p>I basically want to have the DatabaseConnection base class in Python as well, implementing the common methods, and specialize in derived classes, and have a method or function somewhere that based on the connection string constructs and returns the right type of object.</p>
