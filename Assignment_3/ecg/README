This subdirectory contains the ECG database as discussed in

  Robert T. Olszewski.  "Generalized Feature Extraction for Structural
  Pattern Recognition in Time-Series Data."  PhD thesis, Carnegie
  Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 2001.

The ECG database comprises a collection of time-series data sets where
each file contains the sequence of measurements recorded by one
electrode during one heartbeat.  Each heartbeat has an assigned
classification of normal or abnormal.  All abnormal heartbeats are
representative of a cardiac pathology known as supraventricular
premature beat (SVPB).

The data files contained in the ECG database were drawn from the
Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database (SVDB) that is available on the
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database CD-ROM (http://ecg.mit.edu/) and on
PhysioNet (http://www.physionet.org/).  The data files in the ECG
database were assembled from record 801 in the SVDB.  The ECG database
contains a randomly-selected subset of the normal heartbeats and all
the abnormal hearbeats diagnosed with SVPB in record 801 of the SVDB.

The directory structure is as follows:

  ecg/README   - this file
  ecg/abnormal - data files for abnormal heartbeats
  ecg/normal   - data files for normal heartbeats

The name of each data file has the following format:

  <record>_<heartbeat>.<desc>

where

     <record> - the record number; always set to 801
  <heartbeat> - heartbeat number
       <desc> - file descriptor; set as follows:
                    0 - data from lead 0
                    1 - data from lead 1
                  ann - descriptive information
